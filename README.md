# Solve-2048-by-DQN-Double-DQN-and-Dueling-DQN

## Overview
This project aims to tackle the popular sliding block puzzle game "2048" using advanced reinforcement learning techniques. Specifically, it utilizes DQN (Deep Q-Networks), Double DQN, and Dueling DQN algorithms. The goal is to develop AI agents that can consistently solve the game and achieve high scores by learning optimal move strategies.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training neural network models.
- **OpenAI Gym**: Provides a standardized environment for testing our agents.

## Features
- **Model Training**: Train different models using DQN, Double DQN, and Dueling DQN algorithms.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluate each model based on average scores and the number of games solved over multiple trials.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the agent's decision-making process in real-time as it plays the game.
